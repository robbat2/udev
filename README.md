Description
===========
Manages changing settings for udev configuration. Currently only only supports configuring network device ordering at boot. This may be managed via attributes on a role or with a `udev` data bag.

Recipes
=======


ban_network_modules
---
Creates /etc/modprobe.d/<MODULE>-blacklist for each module in ['udev']['banned_modules'], unloads and regenerates initramfs afterwards

rename_interfaces
---
Adds all existing interfaces to ['udev']['net'], naming them ethXX. Good for cases when your interface is named like p1p1, p1p2 etc..
This recipe is mean to be run before 'net'. 

net
---
Populates the `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` with the `['udev']['net']` hash, with keys of ethernet devices (ie. 'eth0') and values of mac addresses. It attempts to read a `udev` data bag if it exists.


udev Role
=========

You may set attributes for udev configuration via a role or with a `udev` data bag. Here is an example role:

```ruby
name "udev"
description "Configure udev"
run_list(
  "recipe[udev::net]"
  )
default_attributes(
  "udev" => {
    "net" => {
      "eth0" => "00:0c:29:49:84:33",
      "eth1" => "00:0c:29:49:84:29"
    }
  })
```

udev Data Bag
=============

In order to manage the udev configuration of machines registering themselves with their Chef Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, we may use a `udev` data bag.

```
% knife data bag create udev
% knife data bag from file udev crushinator.json
```

Here is an example of the crushinator.json, the `id` is the `node.hostname`.

```json
{
    "id": "crushinator,
    "net": {
        "eth0": "00:0c:29:49:84:33",
        "eth1": "00:0c:29:49:84:29"
    }
}
```

Usage
=====

Using either a Role or a `udev` data bag, set the `['udev']['net']` hash with the eth devices in the order desired with their mac addresses. Upon reboot, the ordering will take effect. Works well with the `pxe_dust` cookbook to set the order while provisioning the operating system.
